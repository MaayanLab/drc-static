You will create a model trained on 3D Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) data from human kidneys to help complete a picture of vasculature throughout a body.	The “SenNet + HOA - Hacking the Human Vasculature in 3D” Kaggle competition is now LIVE at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/blood-vessel-segmentation. The Cellular Senescence Program (SenNet) and the Human Organ Atlas (HOA) teams welcome contributions that help ​​​​improve 3D segmentation of vasculature. With better data on the healthy human vasculature, researchers will be able to simulate the flow of blood, oxygen, or even drugs through the vessel network. The 3D segmentation data will also be valuable for understanding how blood vasculature changes for different sex, age, and BMI. Ultimately, 3D vessel segmentation data will help pave the way towards a more complete Vascular Common Coordinate Framework (VCCF) and Human Reference Atlas (HRA) for the healthy human body.

The objective of the course would be to enable people to construct simple Solr API queries to obtain IMPC data based on an understanding of the structure of IMPC data, specifically how knowledge of IMPReSS can be used together with the Solr API to extract datasets from IMPC.
