short_description: Aging signatures are gene expression changes linked to aging. To
  investigate common biological aspects of aging and exercise and identify genes affected
  by both, the study matched aging signatures from GTEx with MoTrPAC rat endurance
  training gene sets.

The goal of the Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) is to assess molecular changes that occur in response to physical activity [1]. To investigate the common biological underpinnings of aging and exercise and discover genes that are induced and repressed due to exercise and also change in levels due to aging, we crossed the aging signatures created from GTEx [2] with the MoTrPAC rat endurance training [3] gene sets.
