short_description: We identify genes associated with a biological process from human,
  mouse phenotypes, KEGG pathways and GO gene set libraries. We then find Consensus
  LINCS compounds that upregulate these genes for inducing the biological process.

We identify genes associated with a biological process from human, mouse phenotypes, KEGG pathways and GO gene set libraries. We then find Consensus LINCS compounds which upregulate these genes resulting in a ranked listing of drug candidates for inducing the biological process.
