The Short Course on Methods for Multiomics Data Analysis will provide practical experience in genomic data science and team training skills using Common Fund data as a vehicle for learning.  The course will transform how scientists do research by introducing new strategies that drive discovery and promote rigorous, reproducible research practices while also creating a collaborative network of researchers and delivering critical skills and practice in team collaboration. A balanced mix of lecture, computational labs, and team building activities will provide participants with experience in state-of-art technical skills as well as social ‘soft skills’ that are often overlooked in scientific training.
