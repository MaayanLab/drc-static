title: Decoding the Data Ecosystem Virtual Symposium
---
The Decoding the Data Ecosystem Virtual Symposium invites faculty, students, and researchers to explore how the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) can support research, education, and discovery in omics-related research. Over the course of an afternoon, explore emerging tools and resources, hear directly from CFDE experts, and discover innovative projects demonstrating how CFDE data can drive discovery across disciplines, including work from participants in this summer’s CFDE mentorship program. Whether you’re looking to integrate real-world data into your curriculum or discover new research directions, this symposium offers practical insights and community connections to help you get started. The CFDE includes a wide range of diverse and valuable datasets for omics-related research including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and beyond.
