The Playbook Workflow Builder (PWB) is a web-based platform that facilitates the interactive construction of workflows by enabling users to utilize an ever-growing network of input datasets, semantically annotated API endpoints, and data visualization tools contributed by an ecosystem. Via a user-friendly web-based user interface (UI), workflows can be constructed from contributed building blocks without technical expertise. The workshop will demonstrate how to use the platform via interactive sessions, as well as, introduce ways the community can contribute to the project.
