This hands-on workshop introduces the Playbook Workflow Builder (PWB), guiding participants through step-by-step recipes to create reusable, transparent, and interoperable bioinformatics workflows aligned with FAIR principles. Attendees will analyze genes, gene sets, and other omics datasets, generate hypotheses, and build shareable workflow components without coding. Working in groups, participants will develop use cases for discovery and leave able to extend PWB, contribute reproducible analyses, and support collaborative research ecosystems.
