short_description: In this lecture, Giacomo Marino, a Bioinformatics Software Engineer in the Ma'ayan Lab at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, describes a new platform for assembling, augmenting, combining, visualizing, and analyzing gene sets. The platform utilizes LLMs to form hypotheses from datasets produced by NIH Common Fund programs.

Converting multi-omics datasets into gene sets facilitates data integration that leads to knowledge discovery. Although there are tools developed to analyze gene sets, only few offer the management of gene sets from multiple sources. GeneSetCart is an interactive web-based platform that enables investigators to gather gene sets from various sources; augment these sets with gene-gene co-expression correlations and protein-protein interactions; perform set operations on these sets such as union, consensus, and intersection; and visualize and analyze these gene sets, all in one place. GeneSetCart supports the upload of single or multiple gene sets, as well as fetching gene sets by searching PubMed for genes co-mentioned with terms in publications. Venn diagrams, heatmaps, UMAP, SuperVenn diagrams, and UpSet plots can visualize the gene sets in a GeneSetCart session to summarize the similarity and overlap among the sets. Users of GeneSetCart can also perform enrichment analysis on their assembled gene sets with external tools. All gene sets in a session can be saved to a user account for reanalysis and sharing with collaborators. GeneSetCart has a gene-set-library crossing feature that enables analysis of gene sets created from several NIH Common Fund programs. For the top overlapping sets from pairs of programs, a large language model (LLM) is prompted to propose possible reasons for the high overlap. Using this feature, two use cases are presented. In addition, users of GeneSetCart can produce publication-ready reports from their uploaded sets. Text in these reports is also assisted with an LLM. Overall, GeneSetCart is a useful resource for biologists without programming expertise to facilitate data integration for hypothesis generation.
