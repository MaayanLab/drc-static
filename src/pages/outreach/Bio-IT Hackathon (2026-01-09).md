The CFDE Training Center (TC) invites you to submit a pitch for a project in the seventh annual Bio-IT FAIR Data Hackathon! The hackathon will take place in Boston, MA on May 18-19, 2026, with a focus on using open-source tools and adhering to FAIR data principles. We are particularly interested in projects that utilize or integrate with CFDE tools and data aiming to improve interoperability between CFDE datasets as well as external datasets. The Training Center has limited travel funds available for individuals who need support and are willing to serve as team leads on selected projects.
