short_description: The objective of the course is to enable researchers to construct
  Solr API queries to obtain IMPC data based on an understanding of how knowledge
  of IMPReSS can be used together with the Solr API.

Due to high demand the registration for the Data API workshop has been closed. But if you’re interested, please register interest to be added to the waiting list and to scope for interest for another session.Please save the date for the 2nd virtual IMPC workshop in the 2024 series, titled ‘IMPC Data API Workshop‘ organised by the IMPC Data Analysis WG/MPI team.The target audience for the workshop would be people familiar with mouse biology and IMPC data to some extent, with some basic knowledge of programming and data transformation, but not necessarily knowledge of using an Apache Solr API.  The objective of the course would be to enable people to construct simple Solr API queries to obtain IMPC data based on an understanding of the structure of IMPC data, specifically how knowledge of IMPReSS can be used together with the Solr API to extract datasets from IMPC.
