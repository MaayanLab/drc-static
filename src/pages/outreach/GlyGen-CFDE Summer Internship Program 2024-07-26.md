The GlyGen-CFDE project is seeking applications for a paid 8-week summer research in-person internship in 2024 for undergraduate and graduate students in Washington DC at George Washington University. This 8-week internship program is tailored to provide hands-on experience in bioinformatics and biology applications in biomedical research through Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) and GlyGen tools and data. Interns will have the opportunity to expand their understanding of biology, biochemistry, and bioinformatics concepts, including exploration and analysis of glycans, proteins, and biomarkers while working on tasks and projects, enabling them to find answers to specific biological questions. The internship will provide benefits such as professional networking, soft skills development, hands-on experience in bioinformatics programming, data wrangling, and exploration of biomedical web resources and tools.
