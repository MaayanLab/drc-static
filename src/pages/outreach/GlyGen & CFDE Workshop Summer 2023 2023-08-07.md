title: GlyGen & CFDE Workshop Summer 2023
---
The purpose of this workshop is to bring together high school students who are interested in developing early-on research knowledge and skills in biochemistry, glycobiology, computer science, and bioinformatics. Each presenter will demonstrate glycan and protein analysis using GlyGen and CFDE tools described above, followed by a Q&A session at the end of the workshop. The attendees will gain basic knowledge on how to efficiently use bioinformatics resources to answer biological questions and provide valuable feedback on the user experience perspective which aids in the continuous development of GlyGen.
