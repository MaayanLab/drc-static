We are currently recruiting for a fully paid Master’s in Data Science Fellowship. The application deadline is the end of the day on April 22, 2024. This opportunity allows students to earn an MPS degree in data science while earning a full stipend to work at CARD with real-world data in the dementia space, working to explore the genetic architecture of disease from a data science perspective. This program is a collaboration with NIH FAES and UMBC. We are particularly passionate about recruiting diverse fellows. We have a blog post featuring interviews with current MPS in Data Science Fellows at CARD – students can learn what it’s like to be in the program: https://card.nih.gov/news-events/card-news/what-its-be-masters-data-science-student-nih-card.
