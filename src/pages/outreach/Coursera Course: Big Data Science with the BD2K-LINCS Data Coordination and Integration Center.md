In this course the LINCS DCC introduces the data generation centers that collected data for the LINCS program. Then, the course covers metadata and how metadata is linked to ontologies. The course then introduces data processing methods used to clean and harmonize the LINCS data. This is followed by discussions about how data is served as RESTful APIs. Most importantly, the course covers computational methods including: clustering, gene-set enrichment analysis, interactive data visualization, and supervised learning.
