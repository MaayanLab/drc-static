description: Subcellular localization, such as the nucleus lysosomes, and mitochondria,
  has tremendous potential to enhance the effectiveness of the therapeutic molecules
  rather than random distribution throughout the cell. With improved subcellular localization
  and enhanced concentration, a specific molecule can be more efficacious as well
  as less toxic which is usually a concern of random distribution and nonspecific
  localization. Therefore, understanding subcellular distribution and the mechanism
  for a specific molecule can further modulate subcellular dysfunction mediated diseases.
  Xenobiotic localization at the subcellular level has a profound effect on several
  processes. The overarching goal of the proposed work is to develop a novel platform
  with computational tools for specific xenobiotic localization. The proposed work
  will take advantage of three common fund datasets. In specific aim-1, we aim to
  develop a suite of machine learning (ML) models for hierarchical levels of micro-compartmentation
  and 40 specific subcellular locations. These machine learning models will be first
  built using three different types of features (fingerprints-based, pharmacophore-based,
  and physicochemical descriptors-based). Then, they are fused using an advanced multilayer
  combinatorial fusion algorithm to get the best consensus model. We will also perform
  the scaffold analysis to identify critical scaffolds that play a role in accumulating
  molecules at specific subcellular locations. In specific aim-2, we will conduct
  experimental validation of the predictions developed ML models. More specifically
  we will test 50 compounds for their subcellular location. In specific aim-3, we
  plan to build an open portal that incorporates datasets, ML model, prediction server,
  and documentation. All the data and models generated from the project are made available
  as open-source.
