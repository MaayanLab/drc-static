description: The NIH Common Fund Data Ecosystem collects together a dozen data-rich
  projects producing high- throughput data with cutting-edge assays. The overall ecosystem
  design includes plans for cross-project data harvesting and analysis on a collaborative
  cloud computing platform. While a long-range plan may culminate in highly structured
  analytic workbenches, we propose to use approaches established in the Bioconductor
  project to design community-driven modular approaches to data structure and interactive
  analysis of selected Common Fund assets. Our first aim is to produce standard, easy
  to use interfaces to resources provided in the 4D Nucleome, Illuminating the Druggable
  Genome, and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects. These Common Fund projects provide
  data of considerable interest by the general research community, but data discovery
  and use is hampered by intrinsic complexity as well as differing access and delivery
  methods adopted by the various Common Fund projects. We will interface well-established
  data containers and query methods to allow familiar R/Bioconductor programming idioms
  to work smoothly with resources from the selected Common Fund projects. The two-decade
  history of Bioconductor's approach to modular software design, documentation, integration,
  and distribution will sharply increase the likelihood of durable improvement in
  access to and utilization of Common Fund Assets. Our second aim is to leverage the
  new interfaces and containers to carry out four analytical projects in the investigation
  of origins of treatment persistent tumor cells in organoid cultures, with the objective
  of identifying compounds that can attenuate and provide insights into epigenetic
  mechanisms of treatment persistence. The operational and substantive outcomes of
  this project will form the basis of a comprehensive, highly community-driven approach
  to building strong bridges between consortia innovating at the cutting edge of biotechnology,
  and scientists innovating in integrative translational inference based on genome
  biology.
