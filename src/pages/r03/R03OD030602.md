description: The NIH Common Fund program has generated a number of transformative
  data sets containing a wide variety of multi-dimensional molecular and phenotypic
  data from human and model organisms. We propose to promote the integration and widen
  the usage of selected Common Fund data sets (KidsFirst, GTEx, and LINCS L1000) using
  UCSC Xena. UCSC Xena is a web-based high-performance resource for functional genomics
  data visualization with a large user base in the cancer genomics research community.
  Xena is already a visualization resource for a Common Fund data set, the GTEx transcriptome,
  which cancer researchers can use to compare gene expression between tumors and matched
  normal tissues. Our proposed work will further widen the usage of the Common Fund
  data sets by providing the scientific community a web-based interactive avenue to
  visualize and explore the data. We also propose to integrate the data with other
  cancer genomics data for pan-cancer across-tissue comparison to identify target
  genes and pathways in patients tumors. Lastly our proposal will extend Xena Browser
  software functionality to use differential gene expression and leverage external
  tools and APIs to search for small molecules that might inhibit tumor growth. We
  propose the following aims. Aim 1. We will add KidsFirst data to Xena and integrate
  it with the cancer genomics data already on Xena to enable comparative visualization
  of molecular profiles across pediatric and adult tumors. Aim 2. Building upon the
  success of the UCSC RNA-seq compendium, we will deliver an even larger uniformly
  analyzed RNA-seq data compendium of over 25,0000 samples from KidsFirst, GTEx, TCGA,
  TARGET, CCLE and other studies. We will openly-share the compendium data using the
  Xena Browser. This rich data resource will support not only users wishing to compare
  expression across tumor to normal tissues, but will also support the Treehouse Childhood
  Cancer initiative in their quest to find treatments for children with cancer. Aim
  3. We will extend Xena software functionality to perform genome-wide differential
  gene expression analysis and connect the analysis results to L1000FWD, a state-of-the-art
  web-based search and visualization tool for tens of thousands of small-molecule
  perturbation signatures profiled by the LINCS L1000 assay. This new feature and
  connectivity will enable users to predict candidate small molecule perturbations
  that might disrupt tumor growth using the reverse tumor gene expression signature
  they identified on Xena.
