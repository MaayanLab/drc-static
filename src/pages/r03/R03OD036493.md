description: "Exercise is associated numerous health benefits, but defining the molecular\
  \ mediators of these effects remains an active focus of biomedical research. With\
  \ the advent of the \u2018omics sciences, studies including the ongoing Molecular\
  \ Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) and multiple smaller-scale\
  \ efforts have sought to map the \u201Ccomplete\u201D molecular response to acute\
  \ and chronic exercise. Much research is currently focused on integration of genomics,\
  \ proteomics and metabolomics data within such studies, but another important strategy\
  \ is meta-analysis of distinct data sets to evaluate consistencies and differences\
  \ in molecular responses observed between different modes of exercise, sex, age,\
  \ species, and other factors. Of the exercise- related meta-studies performed to\
  \ date, most have focused on the genome and transcriptome whereas few have included\
  \ metabolomics data. Reasons for this shortcoming include differences in analytical\
  \ methods, inconsistency in compound naming and data reporting, and prevalence of\
  \ unknown features in untargeted metabolomics data. Unknown metabolite identification\
  \ and cross-study integration is challenging and requires application of computational\
  \ and experimental strategies in a coordinated manner. Yet, the potential benefits\
  \ are substantial \u2013 identification of novel metabolites and detection of consistent\
  \ patterns of response have led to biological insights relevant to fundamental biology\
  \ and human health, including exercise. Using data from NIH Common Fund data archives,\
  \ we propose to develop a multi-study, multi-organism and multi-condition database\
  \ of identified and unknown exercise responsive features of the metabolome. We will\
  \ integrate data across studies and, when available, across \u2018omes, to prioritize\
  \ and identify unknowns within this database. We will achieve these goals by carrying\
  \ out two specific aims: 1) We will perform a comprehensive survey and alignment\
  \ of exercise-related small molecule features in MotrPAC data and from studies in\
  \ the Metabolomics Workbench. We will use computational tools we have pioneered\
  \ for metabolomics data cleaning, inter-laboratory data alignment, and network-\
  \ and correlation-based analysis to prioritize unknown features for follow-up. 2)\
  \ We will systematically track, annotate and identify high-priority exercise-responsive\
  \ unknown features in metabolomics data using software and experimental techniques\
  \ we and others have devised for MS/MS data collection to identify and annotate\
  \ features not tractable by routine library search. Our study represents a crucial\
  \ step between the map-building aims of MoTrPAC and detailed mechanistic studies\
  \ of specific pathways and that hold potential for human health benefits through\
  \ targeted interventions. We will share our database and associated data with the\
  \ research community through publications and uploads to public data archives. We\
  \ anticipate our efforts will contribute to improved understanding of the effects\
  \ of exercise at the biochemical pathway level and will offer targets for future\
  \ studies to help delineate the mechanisms by which small molecules contribute to\
  \ its salutary effects on health."
