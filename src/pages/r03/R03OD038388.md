description: 'Exercise represents one of the most powerful and beneficial interventions
  for health and wellness, though patients with and without chronic disease struggle
  to exercise enough to garner its benefits. One sought after approach to overcoming
  these challenges is to provide the benefits of exercise pharmacologically, a so-called
  "exercise-in-a-pill" solution. This involves identifying biomolecular mechanisms
  responsible for exercise benefits and engaging them pharmacologically using small
  molecule agents. To accelerate discovery of exercise mimetic drugs, this project
  synergizes existing data from two National Institutes of Health Common Fund projects.
  The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) provides a map
  of the biomolecular response to exercise, while the Library of Integrated Network-Based
  Cellular Signatures (LINGS) Program provides a map of the biomolecular response
  to small molecule exposure. The investigators hypothesize that biomolecular exercise
  pathways and small molecule drug candidates from these two resources can be matched
  by their shared biomolecular "signatures". The maps are linked by matching exercise-induced
  changes in biomolecular expression (i.e., a gene expression "signature" of exercise)
  from MoTrPAC to similar expression changes induced by small molecules found in LINGS.
  By linking these two data sets, the project will create a detailed, browsable, and
  interactive resource for identifying potential exercise mimetics. Aim 1 seeks to
  identify biomolecular signatures of exercise training from MoTrPAC by analyzing
  publicly released multi-omic response data from MoTrPAC''s exercise training studies
  in young adult rats. Specific objectives include: 1) identifying biomolecular "signatures"
  through gene set enrichment analysis, network clustering, and gene regulatory networks;
  2) evaluating the validity and reliability of these signatures across tissues, sexes,
  and timepoints in the rat study; and 3) generating an annotated database of signatures
  for alignment with LINGS. Aim 2 integrates MoTrPAC and LINGS biomolecular signatures
  in a cloud-based infrastructure that matches MoTrPAC signatures with those available
  from LINGS. This infrastructure will be designed to 1) organize, browse, and fiter
  the MoTrPAC signatures database; 2) query existing cloud-based applications developed
  by LINGS for engagement with their library of data; and 3) deliver these results
  in a visually informative and interactive web application to maximize the user''s
  ability to gain novel insights. Future efforts will expand the infrastructure by
  adding new MoTrPAC data and annotating exercise signatures with knowledge from other
  Common Fund datasets. Additionally, the project aims to leverage results to identify
  and prioritize pathways related to insulin resistance and other diseases for experimentation
  in model systems. This comprehensive approach seeks to accelerate the identification
  of exercise mimetics and provide valuable resources to translational researchers
  and stakeholders in the pharmaceutical pipeline.'
