description: "Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is an integrative measure of cardiopulmonary\
  \ and metabolic health, and a powerful, independent predictor of future risk of\
  \ mortality. No pharmacotherapies target CRF, and while exercise training (ET) remains\
  \ the only established means to improve fitness, substantial inter-individual variability\
  \ exists in both its intrinsic (untrained) level as well as its response to ET.\
  \ Limited information exists regarding CRF\u2019s underlying biology and identifying\
  \ its molecular underpinnings may help inform our understanding of the determinants\
  \ of this clinically important trait. Emerging data highlight circulating biochemicals,\
  \ and in particular proteins, as mediators of exercise\u2019s health benefits (\u201C\
  exerkines\u201D). To better understand the molecular pathways involved in exercise\
  \ and CRF, the NIH Common Fund created MoTrPAC, the most comprehensive effort to\
  \ study human exercise to date. MoTrPAC includes gold-standard measures of CRF (VO2max),\
  \ and deep molecular profiling - including whole genome sequencing (WGS) and large-scale\
  \ plasma proteomics. Moreover, the MoTrPAC study designs utilizes a randomized,\
  \ controlled trial of ET with a non-exercise control arm to allow for the identification\
  \ of determinants of VO2max changes in response to ET (\uF044VO2max). Though the\
  \ generation of large multi-omics data in MoTrPAC presents enormous opportunity,\
  \ a major challenge remains in identifying the most promising biochemical determinants\
  \ of CRF to be brought forth for further, mechanistic studies. We and others have\
  \ previously shown that integrating genetics, proteomics, and functional genomics\
  \ (e.g. tissue expression and knockout models) using statistical colocalization\
  \ can inform understanding about a protein\u2019s regulation and suggest a causal\
  \ role in health and disease. These studies can, in effect, prioritize plasma proteins\
  \ to be triaged for further investigation. This proposal integrates plasma proteomics,\
  \ WGS and VO2max traits from MoTrPAC with tissue expression data from GTEx to prioritize\
  \ candidate protein determinants of CRF. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel 5,000 assay\
  \ plasma proteomics platform (Olink5K) in ~1,980 MoTrPAC participants undergoing\
  \ ET to identify circulating proteins related to baseline VO2max and \uF044VO2max\
  \ leveraging the non-exercise control arm in MoTrPAC. In Aim 2 we will: A) identify\
  \ locally-acting (cis-) genetic instruments related to plasma proteins from Aim\
  \ 1 (cis-protein quantitative trait loci, pQTLs) from existing, publicly available\
  \ datasets (TOPMed, UK BioBank) as well as generate new cis-pQTLs using WGS from\
  \ MoTrPAC; and B) gain functional insights into the genetic regulation of VO2max-related\
  \ proteins through colocalization with tissue expression in GTEx (expression- or\
  \ eQTLs). These experiments will help determine whether a plasma protein is regulated\
  \ at the transcriptional level and/or in tissues relevant to VO2max (e.g. heart,\
  \ skeletal muscle) and set the stage for further mechanistic studies that extend\
  \ beyond the scope of this project."
