description: We will work with the iHMP data resource to apply novel tools and data
  analysis methodologies to the challenge of disease association between large microbiome
  data sets, Inflammatory Bowel Disease, and the onset of diabetes. We will start
  with an annotation-free approach using k-mers to preprocess IBD and diabetes cohorts.
  We then will apply a novel scaling technology implemented in the sourmash software
  to reduce the data set size by a factor of 2000, rendering it tractable to machine
  learning approaches. We next will use random forests to determine a subset of predictive
  k-mers, and will measure their accuracy on validation data sets not used in the
  initial training. Finally, we will annotate the predictive k-mers using all available
  genome databases as well as a novel method to infer the metagenomic presence of
  accessory genomes of known genomes. Our outcomes will include a catalog of microbial
  genomes that correlate with IBD subtype and the onset of diabetes, as well as automated
  workflows to apply similar approaches to other data sets.
