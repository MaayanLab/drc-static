description: 'To enhance the utility of the common fund supported 4D Nucleome (4DN)
  database and Genotype- Tissue Expression (GTEx) database, we will develop novel
  computational tools for infering the spatial organizations of genomic elements to
  elucidate how eQTLs can regulate the expression of their target genes. Our tools
  will integrate 4DN and GTEx data and overcome the limit of the 2D nature of Hi-C
  frequency heatmaps, enabling construction of large 3D ensembles of high-resolution
  models of single-cell chromatin conformations for loci containing tissue-specific
  genetic variants associated with differential expression. By accounting for 3D polymer
  effects of random collision between genomic elements due to nuclear volume confinement,
  our tools will identify chromatin interactions that are statistically significant
  and likely biologically important. With the ensemble model of single-cell 3D chromatin
  conformations, our tools will further identify participating genes, promoters, enhancers,
  and other elements, and elucidate how they are physically arranged in space around
  genetic variants associated differential gene expression, including how units of
  higher order many-body interaction for gene regulation may form. In addition, our
  tools will quantify the presence of heterogeneous subpopulation of cells with different
  chromatin 3D configurations, allowing probabilistic understanding of the heterogeneous
  physical interactions around eQTLs. With planned comparative analysis of 3D chromatin
  conformations from different tissues, different spatial pattern of arrangement of
  genes and elements important for gene expression will be uncovered, resulting better
  understanding of genome structure and function relationship. Overall, we will demonstrate
  significant added-power of integrating two important Common Fund data resources
  and will provide tools to facilitate understanding the relationship between genome
  topology and gene expression. Our work will enable highly specific and compelling
  testable hypothesis on mechanisms of gene regulation to be formulated based on the
  reconstructed 3D spatial genome topology at loci that harbor variants and eGenes.
  Validation or refutation of these hypotheses will lead to new insight into the relationship
  of genome structure and genome function important for improving human health. '
