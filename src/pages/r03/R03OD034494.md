description: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have highlighted that disease-associated
  human genetic variants are prevalent in noncoding regions and for most of them the
  biological function or gene target remain uncharacterized. To better annotate such
  disease variants, NIH-funded consortia created comprehensive maps of putative regulatory
  elements and identified SNPs associated with gene expression (eQTLs) for different
  tissues and primary cell types. In parallel, breakthroughs in capturing the 3D genome
  structure have demonstrated the importance of cell-type-specific physical proximity
  between genes and their regulatory elements. This 3D view provided a new way through
  which disease-associations of certain variants can be explained. There is an increasing
  interest in utilization of chromatin loops for GWAS variant annotation, however,
  to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive study incorporating eQTL
  data and high-resolution chromatin looping information across many different matched/related
  cell types and tissues to interpret GWAS variants identified for a large set of
  diseases. To goal of this proposal is to utilize NIH Common Fund datasets (GTEx
  and 4D Nucleome) as well as other published chromatin loop and eQTL data to carry
  out different integrative approaches for better annotation of disease-associated
  genetic variants. This will lead to the development of a framework and best practices
  for integrative analysis of loops, eQTLs and GWAS signals. The developed framework
  will be tested on a large number of diseases and disease-relevant cell types to
  create a substantial online resource for researchers. For a subset of the studied
  diseases, for which we have ongoing research interests, we will further analyze
  the identified novel genes, genetic variants and overlapping regulatory elements
  to determine potential targets that warrant further investigation.
