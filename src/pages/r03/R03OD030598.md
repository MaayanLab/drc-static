description: Sex differences in human diseases are well-recognized, but the mechanisms
  are not well understood. This gap of knowledge delays the progress in risk assessment
  and therapeutic strategies for sex-aware precision healthcare. While studies have
  shown significant sex differences in the genetic architectures of complex diseases,
  most investigators opted to do sex- combined analyses in disease genetic studies
  to maximize statistical power. NIH recently began to reinforce the inclusion of
  sex as a biological variable in the design, analysis, and reporting of vertebrate
  animal and human studies. Insights into the functional genetic bases of sex as a
  biological variable are critical to develop therapeutic interventions that equally
  benefit each sex. We recently found that ~1% variants in the population have sex-biased
  allele frequency, including ~10% of disease variants in the Genome Aggregation Database
  (gnomAD). These variants preferentially occur in tissue-specific sex-differentially
  expressed genes. We propose a novel approach to study sex differences in disease
  genetic architectures by leveraging variants that are sex-biased either in allele
  frequency or phenotypic association. We believe this approach will increase the
  statistical power to identify sex-specific or sex interacting causal variants in
  sex- biased diseases. We will identify and characterize sex-biased variants in gnomAD,
  Genotype- Tissue Expression project (GTEx) and Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine
  for sleep disordered breathing phenotypes and venous thromboembolism case-control
  datasets. We will subsequently study the functional mechanisms of these sex-biased
  variants in ~50 GTEx tissues. The completion of this pilot study will advance future
  genetic studies of sex-divergent disorders and accelerate the realization of sex-aware
  genomic medicine.
