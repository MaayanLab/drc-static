description: CTCF binding at its convergent-orientated DNA motifs has been implicated
  in establishing TAD boundary. CTCF protein regulates the genome organization through
  cohesin complex-mediated loop extrusion mechanism. While a few more factors have
  been recently discovered to regulate genome organization, such as NIPBL, WAPL, YY1,
  ZNF143, and MAZ, it is still far from a comprehensive mechanistic understanding
  of how the genome is organized. Discovering novel regulators of genome organization
  is still challenging due to the intensive nature of chromatin conformation capture
  technologies. To address the technical challenge in measuring genome organization,
  we have recently demonstrated that a deep neural network approach can enable de
  novo prediction of cell type- specific chromatin organization at high resolution.
  Moreover, this deep neural network model enables high- throughput in silico genetic
  screen (ISGS) for identifying cell type-specific DNA elements that are important
  for chromatin interactions. To fully unlock the discovery potential of this deep
  neural network-based ISGS approach, here we propose to leverage the NIH Common Fund-supported
  large-scale genomic data across human bio- samples for discovering novel regulators
  in 3D genome organization. We will predict a list of high-confidence trans-acting
  regulators, and experimentally validate 3-5 top hits in pilot studies to generate
  cross-cutting hypotheses for future research in 3D genome regulation.
