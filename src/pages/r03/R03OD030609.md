description: 'This project will develop novel computational methods to leverage diverse
  sources of data sets, including the rich information generated from the NIH Common
  Fund projects, for drug repurposing, which may dramatically lower the risk of drug
  development by skipping early-stage trials, shorten time investment, and cut down
  capital investment. With the advancement of high-throughput sequencing and massively
  parallel technologies, more and more omics data are available for biomedical research.
  These genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and microbiomics data
  can help biomedical researchers better understand the complex biological systems
  underlying human diseases from different perspectives. For example, genome-wide
  association and sequencing studies have successfully identified tens of thousands
  of variants that are significantly associated with one or more complex traits. Despite
  these great successes, the results have not been fully translated into potential
  clinical value. The overall goal of this pilot project is to leverage the rich information
  generated from the NIH Common Funds projects, in combination of other public data
  sets, to explore the feasibility of drug repurposing through novel computational
  approaches. The ultimate goal of our project is to develop, implement, and apply
  a computational framework to integrate data from the Common Fund projects and other
  resources to identify potential uses of existing drugs for new indications, and
  we will also make our newly developed tools available to the general research community.
  This will be accomplished through: [1] further development of a powerful framework
  proposed by our group to leverage cross-tissue information in the GTEx data to achieve
  higher accuracy in imputation of gene expression within each tissue and combine
  single-tissue association tests to derive a powerful test for gene-trait association
  using summary statistics from genome wide association studies; [2] development of
  a signature-matching-based drug repurposing framework with gene expression data
  from diverse sources (drug perturbation experiments, case control studies, and patient
  intervention studies) and GWAS summary statistics; and [3] implementation and application
  of the proposed framework to discover candidate drugs for repurposing to diseases
  in critical need of drug development, e.g. non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. With the
  completion of the pilot project, we will be able to assess the feasibility of the
  proposed framework for drug repurposing for further developments and implementations.'
