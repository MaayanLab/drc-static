description: 'The NIH Common Fund Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx) collected
  whole-genome sequencing and gene expression data from 47 tissues sites of hundreds
  of subjects. It generated a huge impact by providing tissue-level gene expression
  and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) for over 7,000 publications. However,
  tissues are mixtures of myriad cells, and tissue-level gene regulation is affected
  by cellular compositions. To obtain cell-type-specific (CTS) effects, GTEx started
  to collect single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from eight tissue types.
  The single-cell data collection is extremely expensive and labor-intensive, and
  thus snRNA-seq data are only collected from 25 tissue samples of 16 donors that
  may not represent the population. More cost and labor-efficient methods are urgently
  needed to use existing datasets fully. It turns out that with another NIH Common
  Fund project, Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP), we can gain population-
  level insights with HuBMAP single-cell data as a reference by developing computationally
  efficient methods. Complementary to GTEx and other single-cell references, the HuBMAP
  single-cell reference allows us to deconvolve the 47 GTEx tissues into over 200
  cell types. In addition to the cellular fractions, we will calculate CTS eQTLs for
  those cell types at a population scale. Specifically, we will: 1) estimate cellular
  fractions of over 200 cell types from 47 tissue sites across the human body; 2)
  calculate CTS-eQTLs for those hundreds of cell types with statistical rigor and
  power. We will further consider the potential selection bias in the eQTL analysis
  that GTEx collected only normal tissues. The successful completion of this project
  will maximize the usage of NIH Common Fund GTEx and HuBMAP projects to provide a
  new eQTL resource at cell-type resolution. It will be powerful in downstream analyses
  such as CTS colocalization by connecting with genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
  and CTS transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) by predicting genetically
  regulated CTS gene expression. Altogether, this project will provide a global picture
  of the human body at high resolution to map cells to health and complex diseases.'
