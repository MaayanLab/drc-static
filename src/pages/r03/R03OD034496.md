description: "Identifying biomarkers that are diagnostic, robust and generalizable\
  \ across individuals while possessing therapeutic values is the most wanted endeavor\
  \ in medicine. However, there are numerous challenges in the identification of such\
  \ robust therapy-associated biomarkers (TABs). For example, most of the current\
  \ methods seek to achieve statistically significant differential biological signals\
  \ in general patient cohorts but fail to acknowledge heterogenous genetic backgrounds\
  \ and phenotypic diversity among individual patients. Our recent studies using newly\
  \ developed machine learning-based feature engineering approaches and conducted\
  \ in a pan-cancer study across 12 cancer types showed that biologically constrained\
  \ features (named herein invariant features) are universal in disease and can be\
  \ used to classify individual cancers. Importantly, we also show that invariant\
  \ features can be used to build de novo biological networks and discover network\
  \ hubs that can be successfully utilized to infer the expression of associated genes.\
  \ As such, invariant features can act as information encoders. Using information\
  \ from Drug Repurposing Hub we show that these hub genes are also drug targets.\
  \ Collectively, these observations suggest that invariant feature hubs can be TAB\
  \ candidates. We propose that under the new light of biological constraints, we\
  \ can use a dynamic approach for biomarker discovery that encapsulates both the\
  \ genetic heterogeneity and molecular fluctuation across individual patients. Our\
  \ central hypothesis is that disease states show constrains in their molecular activities,\
  \ and identifiable invariable features possess diagnostic and therapeutic values.\
  \ The main objective of this proposal is to uncover TABs using selected NIH Common\
  \ Fund datasets (namely, exRNA, GTEx, LINC, and IDG). In Aim 1, we will test the\
  \ hypothesis that biologically constrained invariant features are universal to most\
  \ if not all biological states. We will show this by finding invariant features\
  \ with respect to each biological state from selected Common Fund datasets. We will\
  \ conduct comparative analyses in disease and normal states in order to dissect\
  \ disease-specific invariant features. Next, in Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis\
  \ that invariant feature hubs are TABs. We will show this by determining the diagnostic\
  \ capability of invariant feature hubs for their \u201Cencodability\u201D to reconstruct\
  \ the expression values of their associated invariant feature genes in different\
  \ individual patients diagnosed under same disease type. Finally, we will map these\
  \ invariant feature hubs to IDG and DrugBank to determine their druggability. For\
  \ those understudied hubs with no known drugs, we will perform computational analyses\
  \ such as homology modeling and machine learning to characterize their druggability.\
  \ We expect timely accomplishment of proposed aims and successful completion of\
  \ this project will no doubt provide added values for the selected Common Fund datasets,\
  \ while providing a new paradigm shift of biomarker and therapeutic target discovery."
