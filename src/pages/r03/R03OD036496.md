description: Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) are crucial components of transcriptional
  regulation and the rapid growth of genomic data has enabled researchers to annotate
  CREs across many biological contexts. However, despite the comprehensiveness of
  these collections, understanding the rules dictating how CREs regulate genes remains
  a major unresolved problem in genomics. Therefore, to better understand gene regulation,
  we are proposing to develop a new framework where CRE-gene interactions are modeled
  as graphs. This will enable researchers to accomplish a wide range of computational
  tasks such as comparisons between cell types, predictions of new interactions, and
  predictions of gene expression. Specifically, this pilot project aims to evaluate
  the feasibility and generalizability of a CRE-interaction graph approach for predicting
  gene expression. We will build CRE-interaction graphs in three biological contexts
  using public datasets, including those generated by Common Fund projects, by integrating
  genomic interaction data, such as CRISPR perturbations and Hi-C loops, with annotated
  CREs. Then to demonstrate the utility of these graph models, we will use graph neural
  networks to predict gene expression, testing different algorithms and gene expression
  qualifications to maximize model performance. Finally, we will use feature attribution
  methods and prediction explainer algorithms to interpret our models to gain a better
  understanding of the mechanisms regulating transcription. The project will not only
  lead to a better model for predicting gene expression, but also establish a flexible
  framework for future research on gene regulation. The project will also produce
  a resource for the computational and machine learning community and improve the
  utility of existing resources.
