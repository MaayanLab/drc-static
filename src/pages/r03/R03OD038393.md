description: "Unraveling the molecular mechanisms that link SNPs and genes identified\
  \ in GWAS studies to the disease is a challenge that must be overcome to translate\
  \ these genetic discoveries into actionable health insights. We would like to build\
  \ a machine learning tool on the basis of visible neural networks (vNN) that recently\
  \ showed success to provide predictive and explanatory power on cellular responses\
  \ to gene regulations or disease treatment. Key to the vNN approach is an understandable\
  \ network such as Knowledge Graph that contains rich annotations of relevant entities\
  \ and relationships among entities organized by integrative data sources. Our hypothesis\
  \ is that organizing and integrating data from the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE)\
  \ can enhance the explanatory power of vNN to illuminate GWAS results. We propose\
  \ combining the ROBOKOP Knowledge Graph with diverse biological data from the CFDE,\
  \ and vNN as a knowledge-based architecture to provide high interpretability in\
  \ supervised learning. ROBOKOP Knowledge Graph will serve as an organizational hub\
  \ for integrating CFDE data with existing knowledge. This query-able resource for\
  \ CFDE data will be our first deliverable. We will extract network-based relationships\
  \ from this data and train vNN using genotypes and phenotypes from T2D-focused GWAS,\
  \ providing our second deliverable. The trained vNN, our third deliverable, will\
  \ enable the prediction of T2D phenotypes from genotype data. Lastly, we'll provide\
  \ the code base as a platform to expand this KG and vNN approach to other GWAS studies\
  \ and potentially be generalized for genome wide \u2018omic analyses with large\
  \ data sets."
