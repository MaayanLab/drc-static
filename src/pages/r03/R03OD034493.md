description: "The lack of uniformity in published experimental methods and data is\
  \ a major impediment for the research community to compare, corroborate, and build\
  \ upon biomedical discoveries. The FAIR data principles state that research data\
  \ should be \u201Cfindable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.\u201D Public\
  \ metabolomics data repositories and large-scale studies supported by the NIH Common\
  \ Fund, including Metabolomics Workbench and the Integrated Human Microbiome Project\
  \ (iHMP), and other public mass spectrometry data repositories, such as the Global\
  \ Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) and MetaboLights, have made\
  \ progress in recent years to address the first two FAIR principles by making metabolomics\
  \ data easily findable and accessible. Unfortunately, the final two FAIR principles,\
  \ which state that data should be interoperable and reusable, have not been adequately\
  \ addressed yet by the metabolomics community. This prevents metabolomics data from\
  \ multiple relevant studies to be compared and co-analyzed. This proposal aims to\
  \ bridge this interoperability and reusability gap by harmonizing community standards\
  \ and creating accompanying computational tools for data re-analysis. Specifically,\
  \ this proposal will 1. Standardize and convert mass spectrometry data formats (Aim\
  \ 1), 2. Harmonize experimental metadata and analysis results with common controlled\
  \ vocabulary with consistent semantics across all experiments (Aim 1), 3. Develop\
  \ web infrastructure to find and explore datasets by metadata (Aim 1), and 4. Develop\
  \ cloud-enabled portable, reusable, and scalable co-analysis bioinformatics pipelines\
  \ (Aim 2). Successful completion of these aims will democratize the ability for\
  \ the entire metabolomics community to corroborate published findings, discover\
  \ new metabolites that are highlighted only when co-analyzing datasets, and test\
  \ translational hypotheses across different model organisms."
