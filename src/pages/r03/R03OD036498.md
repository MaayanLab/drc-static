description: 'Pediatric cancer is the leading cause of disease-related death in children,
  yet very few drugs are specifically labeled for pediatric malignancies, underscoring
  a need to identify novel molecular therapeutic targets to improve outcomes for children
  with cancer, which is our long-term goal. Specifically, diffuse pediatric high-
  grade gliomas (pHGGs) are resistant to multi-modal treatment and have had no new
  FDA-approved drugs in the past 20 years, thus patients with these tumors are in
  urgent need of novel, effective therapeutic strategies. Aberrant splicing contributes
  to neoepitope formation and represents a class of untapped targetable genetic alterations
  that are largely unexplored in pHGG. Our central hypothesis of this research plan
  is that aberrant splicing events can result in tumor-specific neoepitopes in pHGGs
  and these data can be rapidly harnessed and prioritized for therapeutic targeting.
  The proposed work will test this hypothesis with two integrated specific aims: 1)
  identify putative immunotherapeutic subtype-specific splice targets in pHGGs and
  2) characterize aberrant splice variation in pHGG preclinical models and validate
  immunotherapeutic splice targets for preclinical testing. These studies will integrate
  transcriptional splice events with tumor tissue expression (PBTA and Kids First
  X01), normal tissue expression (GTEx and available pediatric matched tissue normals),
  peptide sequences (UniProt), and known extracellular domain annotations (UniProt)
  to identify and prioritize neoepitopes generated in pHGGs. This work will elucidate
  novel splice-driven immunotherapeutic targets through rigorous integrative computational
  analysis of splice variation in pHGG tumors, coupled with orthogonal molecular assays,
  to validate presence and expression of these targets. The successful completion
  of this project will generate significant new knowledge of aberrant splicing programs
  in pHGG and will identify potential immunotherapeutic targets. This work is critical
  to understanding the genetic contributions of aberrant splicing to pediatric cancer,
  will enable the research and clinical communities to rationally inform novel immunotherapeutic
  strategies for pHGG, and will serve as a roadmap for investigation of neoepitopes
  in other pediatric brain tumors. This work is highly relevant to the critical mission
  of the National Cancer Institute to advance scientific knowledge and identify novel
  strategies to improve overall survival of cancer patients.'
