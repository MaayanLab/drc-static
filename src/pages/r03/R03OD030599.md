description: "After the completion of the Human Genome Project, several landmarking\
  \ consortia have accumulated large amounts of genomic data towards understanding\
  \ the functions of human genome. The ENCODE project has annotated genome-wide regulatory\
  \ elements. The Roadmap Epigenomic project has characterized tissue-speci\uFB01\
  c variation in epigenetic state. The NIH Common Fund GTEx project has delineated\
  \ tissue-speci\uFB01c gene expression and transcription regulation. The NIH Common\
  \ Fund 4D Nucleome (4DN) project has revealed dynamic 3D chromatin organization\
  \ in many cell and tissue types. Each of the aforementioned consortia has generated\
  \ thousands or even tens of thousands of datasets, and provided different insights\
  \ regarding human genome at an unprecedent scale and depth. However, the datasets\
  \ generated from these consortia are isolated in terms of cell types and tissue\
  \ types covered, how the data are stored, and the resolution of the genomic data.\
  \ These gaps bring realistic data analysis challenges to biomedical researchers\
  \ when they use these public datasets jointly in their research \u2014 they need\
  \ to go through different data portals with heterogeneous processing pipelines,\
  \ different data formats, and unmatched resolutions. We aim to develop the most\
  \ cutting-edge deep learning approaches to impute high-resolution chromatin contact\
  \ maps, and integrate the high-resolution chromatin contact maps with transcriptional\
  \ data available from GTEx project and epigenomic data from ENCODE/Roadmap. We plan\
  \ to share the integrated data on a public web server with a multi-panel interactive\
  \ visualization genome browser. The integrated data will provide an important resource\
  \ for understanding of tissue-speci\uFB01c genetic variation in the light of the\
  \ spatial organization of these genomic and epigenomic elements and their functional\
  \ implications."
