  CF programs

The CFDE RNA-seq Pipeline Harmonization partnership is a collaboration between multiple DCCs (GTEx, UDN, KF, HuBMAP, SPARC, MoTrPAC) to update their RNA-seq pipelines across the DCCs with a revised version of the STAR RNA-seq aligner. The goal is to enable uniform alignment to a reference genome by reprocessing all the existing accessible bulk-tissue RNA-seq datasets.
