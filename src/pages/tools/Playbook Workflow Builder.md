The Playbook Workflow Builder (PWB) is a web-based platform that facilitates knowledge resolution by enabling users to traverse an ever-growing network of input datasets, semantically annotated API endpoints, and data visualization tools. Via a user-friendly user-interface, workflows can be constructed from these building-blocks without technical expertise. The output of these workflows is provided as reports containing textual descriptions, interactive figures, and downloadable tables.
