The Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph (UBKG) is a knowledge graph database that represents a set of interrelated concepts from biomedical ontologies and vocabularies. The UBKG combines information from the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with assertions from “non-UMLS” ontologies or vocabularies.
