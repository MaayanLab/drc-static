agenda:
- label: Improved Methods to Query the LINCS L1000 Data
  presenters:
  - affiliation: LINCS Data Coordination Center and the CFDE Data Resource Center
    presenter: Avi Ma'ayan, PhD
  summary: 'The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) was
    an NIH Common Fund program that was established to catalog how human cells globally
    respond to chemical, genetic, and disease perturbations. Resources generated by
    LINCS include experimental and computational methods, visualization tools, molecular
    and imaging data, and gene expression signatures. The presentation will cover
    LINCS datasets, tools, and a newly developed method to query the LINCS L1000 data
    for better prioritization of drugs, small molecules and single gene perturbations.<br/><br/>Relevant
    resources that will be discussed: <br/>**Rummagene**: https://rummagene.com/  <br/>**SigCom
    LINCS**: https://maayanlab.cloud/sigcom-lincs/ <br/>**Playbook Workflow Builder**:

- label: Automatic Mining of Human and Mouse Gene Sets from GEO
  presenters:
  - affiliation: LINCS Data Coordination Center and the CFDE Data Resource Center
    presenter: Giacomo Marino
  summary: 'RummaGEO is a web server application that enables gene expression signature
    search against thousands of human and mouse RNA-seq studies deposited into GEO.
    To enable such a search engine, an offline automatic process was established to
    identify the experimental conditions from uniformly aligned GEO studies available
    from ARCHS4. Once conditions are identified, differential expression signatures
    are computed to extract gene sets from these signatures. In total, RummaGEO currently
    contains 135,264 human and 158,062 mouse gene sets from 23,395 GEO studies. Overall,
    RummaGEO provides an unprecedented resource for the biomedical research community
    enabling hypothesis generation for many future studies.<br/><br/> Relevant resources
