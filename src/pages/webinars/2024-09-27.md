  summary: This lecture by Keyang Yu, a member of ERCC (https://exrna.org/) DCC, was
    about tools and methods for discovering disease-causing gene regulatory variants
    from WGS data, with application to congenital heart disease. To overcome the limitations
    of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), Keyang Yu introduced a framework for
    the discovery of pathogenic non-coding variants. The framework uses point-wise
    mutual information (PMI) models and aggregates regulatory information using the
    CFDE Link Data Hub (CFDE LDH; https://genboree.org/cfde-gene/ui/).
