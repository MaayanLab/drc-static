The CONNECT Integration and Coordination Center (ICC) is dedicated to advancing biomedical research within the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) by enhancing efficiency, transparency, and innovation. Led by Prof. Jake Chen at UAB, alongside Profs. Casey Greene, Sean Davis, Peipei Ping, and Wei Wang, the ICC integrates three key cores—Administrative, Evaluation, and Sustainability—to drive its mission forward.<br/><br/>The Administrative Core, led by Prof. Chen, ensures seamless coordination and project management across CFDE entities. Utilizing Agile methodologies and collaboration tools like U-BRITE, it optimizes communication and accelerates scientific progress. The Evaluation Core, led by Profs. Greene and Davis, focuses on continuous quality improvement, developing evaluation metrics and feedback mechanisms to assess and enhance CFDE initiatives. Meanwhile, the Sustainability Core, led by Prof. Ping with support from Prof. Wang, ensures the long-term accessibility and reusability of CF program data through strategic data management practices and repository planning.<br/><br/>By integrating these efforts, the CONNECT ICC fosters collaboration, accelerates biomedical discoveries, and strengthens CFDE’s long-term impact. Through innovative methodologies and expert leadership, it is positioned to drive transformative advancements in biomedical research.
