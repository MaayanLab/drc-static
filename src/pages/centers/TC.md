short_description: The CFDE Training Center will expand data accessibility by providing tailored training, mentoring, and outreach, fostering a diverse learning community to enhance biomedical research and data use.
---
The CFDE Training Center (TC) will ensure that Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) data, tools, and resources are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Serving as the central hub for training development, coordination, and evaluation, the TC will expand the CF data user base, enhance dataset usage, and increase awareness of CFDE resources.

Team ORAU will achieve this through targeted training programs, outreach initiatives, and a collaborative learning community. The TC will design customized training materials for a diverse audience, with a focus on postgraduate students and early-career investigators. A CFDE Mentoring Program will pair learners with experienced bioinformaticians to provide technical and professional guidance, fostering careers in bioinformatics and data science. Additionally, the TC will ensure diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) through targeted recruitment, a Diversity Committee, and an inclusive learning environment.

To support collaboration, the TC will establish a CFDE Trainers Working Group to share best practices, a CFDE Landing Page for centralized training resources, and a Virtual Community of Learners for engagement and ongoing support. Development will be informed by a comprehensive landscape analysis, including gap assessments, literature reviews, and stakeholder input. Ongoing evaluation will guide program improvements and ensure alignment with CFDE and NIH goals.

Led by a skilled team from Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) and BioData Sage LLC, the TC will be managed through structured project controls, ensuring effective, flexible coordination with NIH and CFDE stakeholders. Through these efforts, the TC will build a strong, supportive ecosystem for training biomedical researchers in data-driven science.
