In coordination with other CFDE Centers and funded programs and projects, the Training Center (TC) acts as a central hub to provide a comprehensive approach to support current and potential CFDE users on their learning journey. It aims to expand the CFDE data userbase and enhance the confidence and complexity of dataset usage through community building and engagement activities.<br/><br/><br/> The TC will provide training in basic and advanced computational and data analytic skills for data science learners and users to engage meaningfully with CFDE data and tools in research and increase awareness and attract new users from the bioinformatics, data science, and research communities through a variety of initiatives internal and external to the CFDE, including attendance at conferences and other activities and opportunities.
