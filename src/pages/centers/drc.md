short_description: The CFDE Workbench provides data and information portals, that enables users to access CF data, query biological entities, and engage with standardized, FAIR, AI-ready resources for biomedical research collaboration.
---
The CFDE Data Resource Center (DRC) was tasked with developing two web-based portals: an **Information Portal** to serve information about the CFDE and a **Data Portal** to host harmonized metadata and processed data contributed by participating CF Data Coordination Centers (DCCs) and other sources. By combining the data and information portals, the **CFDE Workbench** is a comprehensive resource where users can collect both information and data from CFDE and CF resources, as well as query disease, gene, drug, and other biological entities across standardized data formats from each CF DCC. The CFDE Workbench consolidates efforts toward making CF programs funded resources harmonized, FAIR, and AI-ready.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the DRC team works collaboratively with the other CFDE newly established centers, the participating CFDE DCCs, the CFDE NIH team, and relevant external entities and potential consumers of these three software products. These interactions will be achieved via face-to-face meetings, virtual working groups meeting, one-on-one meetings, Slack, GitHub, project management software, and e-mail exchange. Via these interactions, we will establish standards, workstreams, feedback and mini projects towards accomplishing the goal of developing a lively and productive Common Fund Data Ecosystem.<br/><br/>The **Data Portal** of the CFDE Workbench catalogs several types of uniformly processed data and metadata filesand other digital objects from each participating DCC. The **Information Portal** provides relevant information about each DCC and on overarching consortium activities that include training and outreach events, brief descriptions of CFDE partnership projects, and detailed community-established protocols.
