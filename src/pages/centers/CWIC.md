short_description: The CFDE Cloud Workspace enables researchers to analyze, integrate, and share data with powerful tools, fostering collaboration and accelerating discoveries through free computational resources and training.
---
The CFDE Cloud Workspace is designed to provide researchers with an accessible and collaborative environment for data analysis. It allows users to import and integrate data with Common Fund datasets while utilizing a wide range of analysis tools, workflows, and pipelines. The Cloud Workspace Implementation Center (CWIC) streamlines deployment by leveraging key partnerships: TACC’s high-performance computing resources, Galaxy’s open-source interface for data analysis, and CloudBank’s tools for simplified cloud access and billing. 

This workspace supports both novice and expert users by offering training, outreach, and cost-management tools to optimize resource usage. Users will have access to a variety of tools developed by CFDE, Galaxy, and other partners, with the flexibility to incorporate custom or third-party tools. By providing free storage and compute resources, the Cloud Workspace lowers barriers to entry, enabling researchers to work with large datasets and complex analyses.

By fostering data sharing, collaboration, and ease of access, CWIC accelerates biomedical research and supports a broader scientific community in tackling high-priority challenges. This initiative represents a significant step toward expanding access to advanced computational resources and empowering researchers to drive innovation in the field.
