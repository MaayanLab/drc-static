# CFDE Partnerships
The CFDE has funded collaborative DCC partnership projects that will develop approaches and tools to harmonize data and workflows from multiple Common Fund programs enabling cross-dataset analysis. These partnerships are meant to enhance DCC-DCC interactions. In addition, these partnerships aim to demonstrate the utility of their data integration tools and approaches for CF datasets to the broader scientific community.
