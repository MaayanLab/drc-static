title: Analyze a Gene with DD-Knowledge Graph UI
---
The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Data Distillery Knowledge Graph (DD-KG) partnership aims to establish a Knowledge Graph that integrates knowledge assertions from CFDE-affiliated Data Coordination Centers (DCCs). DD-KG-Ul is a web-based interface that enables users to efficiently query the DD-KG. Queries can range from simple single-term searches, revealing immediate neighboring terms, to more complex inquiries about two terms, showcasing the shortest paths between specified nodes or terms. CFDE DD-Knowledge Graph is now available from the gene page to query.
