### Documentation

This page contains descriptions of CFDE consortium standards, protocols, user guides, and other documents generated by the CFDE centers, partnerships, and Data Coordination Centers (DCCs).

These documents are intended to provide CFDE-partnered DCCs, other Common Fund (CF) programs, and the broader research community with documentation about digital object products developed by the CFDE. While many of these documents were created within the context of the CFDE, they may be useful and generalizable for other researchers who are interested in using or interoperating with CF datasets, or who are interested in improving the FAIRness of their own resources.
