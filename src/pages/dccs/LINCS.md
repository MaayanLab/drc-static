The Common Fund’s Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program developed a library that catalogs changes that occur when different types of cells are exposed to a variety of agents that disrupt normal cellular functions, called “perturbagens.” This library integrated data across cell types, perturbagens, and measurements of cellular responses for use by scientists to design and conduct experiments that can help us better understand normal and diseased cellular states and how to alter them.
