The NIH Common Fund’s Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) program will propel biomedical research forward by setting the stage for widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) that tackles complex biomedical challenges beyond human intuition. A key step in this process is generating new “flagship” data sets and best practices for machine learning analysis. Machine learning is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides machines (like computers) the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience, without being explicitly programmed. The biomedical research community generates a wealth of data, but most of these data are not suitable for machine learning because they are incomplete. By bringing technological and biomedical experts together with social scientists and humanists, the Bridge2AI program will help bring solutions to this deficit.
