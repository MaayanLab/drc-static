The Molecular Transducers of Physical Activity Consortium (MoTrPAC) aims to uncover, at the molecular level, how exercise improves and maintains the health of the body’s tissues and organs. Tracking exercise’s impact on biological molecules through time will help MoTrPAC researchers create a map of molecular changes in the body. Studies in three human tissues will be complemented by more extensive studies in an animal model, allowing many additional tissue types to be explored and substantially increasing the impact of the consortium. Researchers will use the molecular map to better understand how exercise affects people of different ages, sexes, body compositions, and fitness levels. In the future, it may also enable clinicians to make more specific exercise recommendations to patients when using exercise as an intervention to improve health.
