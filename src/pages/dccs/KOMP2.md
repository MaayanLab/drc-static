The Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Program (KOMP2) collaborates with the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) to knockout and characterize all protein-coding genes in the mouse genome. Knocking out the activity of a gene provides valuable clues about what that gene normally does but creating mice with gene knockouts is a time-consuming and difficult process, and often is done by individual research labs with varied approaches.
