The NIH Common Fund’s Somatic Cell Genome Editing (SCGE) program aims to reduce the burden of diseases caused by genetic changes. Genome editing technologies present an exciting prospect for treatments and possibly even cure for these diseases. During its first 5-year phase (FY18-FY23), SCGE developed quality tools to perform and assess effective genome editing tools in non-reproductive (“somatic”) cells of the body. In its second phase (FY23-27), SCGE will accelerate the translation of genome editing therapies into the clinic.
